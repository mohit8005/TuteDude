In this project, I created a reusable custom React hook named useFetch to simplify API data fetching. The hook manages loading, success, and error states using useState, useEffect, and useCallback. I used a public API to fetch product data and displayed it using a simple React component. This approach improves code reusability and separation of concerns. The project was deployed on Netlify and the source code is hosted on GitHub.
