In this project, I created a reusable custom React hook named useFetch to simplify API data fetching.
The hook internally uses:
        -> useState for state management
        -> useEffect for side effects
        -> useCallback for optimized reusability

 
 -> A public API is used to fetch product data, which is displayed using a simple React component.
 -> This approach improves code reusability, clean architecture, and separation of concerns.
